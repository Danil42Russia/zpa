## SonarQube PL/SQL Community plugin
This plugin adds PL/SQL support to the [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org). SonarQube is an open platform to manage code quality. This project supports SonarQube 4.5.5 and newer.

## Contribute
You are welcome to contribute. PL/SQL and Oracle SQL are big languages and there are many pieces missing in the [grammar](https://github.com/felipebz/sonar-plsql/blob/master/plsql-squid/src/main/java/br/com/felipezorzo/sonar/plsql/api/PlSqlGrammar.java).

## Alternatives:
If you're looking for PL/SQL support in SonarQube, there is also 
the [commercial plugin from SonarSource](http://www.sonarsource.com/products/plugins/languages/plsql/).

<p>
In Oracle Forms, many procedures and functions need a reference to an object (blocks, itens, alerts...).
Unfortunately, the only way to pass a reference to an object is using a VARCHAR2 variable and these references
are not checked by the compiler.

<p>Currently this rule checks the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>SHOW_LOV</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: this rule is automatically disabled when the project's <code>sonar.plsql.forms.metadata</code> is not specified.</p>.
